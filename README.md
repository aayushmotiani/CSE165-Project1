The main scene of our project is called BasicScene.
 <br />
 <br />
Player movement script is called PlayerLocomotion.cs and object spawning script is called ObjectSpawning.cs. Both files are located in the root Assets folder.

Player interaction is managed by the "Our XR Interaction Manager" gameobject. It uses the Interactionforobjects.cs script to manage scaling, rotation and selection/manipulation of objects.
